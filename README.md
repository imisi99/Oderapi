# Oderapi
This is an orderapi created for fun using FastAPI and SQLAlchemy
It uses 0auth for its authorization and jwt for it's authentication
All it's routes are locked and requires a user to be logged in (all routes can be seen using the FASTAPI swagger UI)
The user needs to signup first, then log in with 0auth
